# wizlight-experiment

[WiZ](https://www.wizconnected.com/en-gb) is a standard way for interacting with WiFi connected devices.

Trying out [pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight) to control
a [WiZ](https://www.wizconnected.com/en-gb) lightbulb. Seems fairly straightforward.

Only using a single light bulb here. The aysnc code likely more useful when
interacting with more than one device!s
