# wizlight-experiment

[WiZ](https://www.wizconnected.com/en-gb) is a standard way for interacting with
WiFi connected devices.

Trying out [pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight) to control
a [WiZ](https://www.wizconnected.com/en-gb) lightbulbs. Seems fairly straightforward.

## Files
- `light.py` - First go. Detects bulbs and then updates colours of each one a
few times.
- `set-lights.py` - Finds all bulbs on LAN  and sets each one to repeatedly
change colour in approx rainbow order, with bulbs in different steps in the
colour sequence.
